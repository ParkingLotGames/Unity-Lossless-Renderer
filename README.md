# Unity Lossless Renderer
 
 ## An editor and runtime renderer that outputs frame captures and uses ffmpeg to join them in a video. It can also download and install ffmpeg globally or locally.

### Only 2019.1+ versions are officially supported, prior versions are not able to download ffmpeg if it's not installed and might require to close and reopen the window after creating the settings asset for the first time to properly recognize ffmpeg. Local path for ffmpeg is Project/localffmpeg/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl/bin/ffmpeg.exe
