# Unity Lossless Renderer
 
 ### An editor and runtime renderer that outputs frame captures and uses ffmpeg to join them in a video. It can also download and install ffmpeg globally or locally.

#### Only 2019.1+ versions are officially supported

For prior versions, download the [2018_OR_LOWER](https://github.com/ParkingLotGames/Unity-Lossless-Renderer/tree/2018_OR_LOWER) branch but be aware that those versions are not able to download ffmpeg if it's not installed.

Local path for ffmpeg is Project/localffmpeg/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl/bin/ffmpeg.exe
